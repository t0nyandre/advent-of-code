  This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code. I might be going back in time to get some of the older ones done as well, but right now I am focusing on 2024.

# Advent of Code
These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.

I don't aim to be first on any leaderboard. I aim to have fun solving the coding problems!

## Issue
If you see any issue or see a better way of solving these puzzles, please raise an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/t0nyandre/advent-of-code/issues/new). I am all about learning so I'd love any input I can get!
